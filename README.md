# Generative Networks.
Generative Adverserial Networks are an approach to generative data modelling using Deep learning methods.
Implementing generative networks to develop a stremlined data generation model.


I have currently implemented :
- [x] [DCGAN](GAN) on CIFAR dataset.
- [x] [Variational Autoencoder](VAE) on MNIST dataset.
